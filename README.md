# Minetest Mods

## Overview

A collection of mods that I'm working on for myself and friends. The mods
are in the mods folder and anything prefixed with `lup` was written as a part
of this project and should be compatible with other mods. This project is a
side-side-project but if you are using it and have an issue, feel free to submit
an issue on GitHub and I'll try to take a look.

## Make targets

Currently these targets only support Linux systems, but the mods should run on
any current Minetest version.

### `link`

Symlink the mod folders into the games mods folder

### `test` (TODO)

Run the unit tests
